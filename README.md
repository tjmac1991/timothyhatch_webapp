# Getting Started

This project built/bundled and locally served using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) for more information.

### `npm run serve`

Serves the build as it would look in production from the `dist` folder as a preview locally.\
This is not meant as a production server. [see more here for static deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)
